# Python Unittest Mocking

This project is a small task set within QA Academy in order to practice unit test mocking.
I am attempting to achieve 100% unit test coverage on a Flask API, through the use of mock patching.

## Description

For this task, I will be using unittest.mock.patch() as a function decorator - changing the behaviour of how a particular function behaves.

In particular, I will be mock patching a number of HTTP responses to external API's, so that we do not actually need to be connected to the internet in order to test the application.
